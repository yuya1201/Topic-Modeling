While I've worn running shoes for the past 5 years, I was (1) tired of ruining athletic shoes and socks with various bodily fluids and (2) wanted to see if clogs/slip-ons would be different.  Yes, the Jungle Mocs work well, and I think they're superior to clogs.  The Mocs breathe more but provide enough grip to snugly fit my foot.  I can fly up stairs with ease.  Though they felt heavy at first, after a couple of 24 hour+ shifts, they broke in, and my feet enjoy the extra cushioning.  I can spend hours in the OR without getting the wearying pressure/constriction sensation.  And if I do have some downtime, I can pop 'em off with ease.  Plus, blood and other stuff seem to wipe off easily.  I've only had these a couple of months and will update in a few more regarding their durability.\",\n",

I've walked ~50 miles in the rain with these so far and the water beads up nicely on the tops of the shoes. My feet stay warm and dry.The only minor complaint I have: the soles feel a little bit like walking on a platform (imagine a rigid wooden sandal). But after a couple days I got used to it. It's simply a different type of shoe. I was used to tennis shoes and dress shoes. They have the tough, knobby bottom on them -- probably great for hiking!\",\n",

As far as fit goes, they were nearly perfect, only being slightly too large in the heighth of the toe box (which I'm sure is partially due to my flat feet). I added a 6mm wool insole, inserted under the one provided and they now fit like a dream.  I'm looking forward to wearing these for many years to come and I'm even considering getting a pair for my Da, as he also has wide feet and hates to do up laces because of his stiff back.\",\n",

Both are very comfortable and I've worn them in the snow. My feet were warm and I didn't slide.  (They're probably not designed for snow, though).With these black units, my heals kept coming out. Took me a while to figure out why. The elastic on the top wasn't strong enough -- not like my other colors. I called Merrill, and they sent me new inserts and I wore thicker socks. Same thing. I just sent them to Merrill for inspection. Based upon the new ones they send me, I may change this review.\",\n",

Otherwise the shoes are completely functional, fit great, and will become a nice soft pair of house shoes for several more years of service I am sure.  The odd sizing title of this review comes from the fact that normally I wear a 9w or 9.5w mens shoe and these are an 8w and fit perfect.  I have never worn an 8.  The previous 4 pairs of shoes and boots I have ordered or bought were 9.5w and fit perfect.  I ordered these in size 9.5w and was swimming in them! Amazon replaced them (I had to pay shipping) with size 9w and again they felt huge! Again, I paid shipping to send them back, and when these 8w's arrived I felt I finally got the shoe I expected in a size 9.  I should give these shoes 5 stars, and I want to, but alas, the sizing fiasco is unnecessary and cost me an extra $12 in return shipping. These shoes are great, but beware funny sizing.\",\n",

As other reviewers have noted, they feel almost like a slipper; they have excellent arch support, and they cup the outside edge of the foot wonderfully.  They were becoming my \"go-to\" shoe until the rubber sole started coming unglued.  I have not subjected them to any extraordinary circumstances--just around town and around the house duty.  But there is now a very large gap on one shoe stretching from the middle/arch section to the toe where the sole is separating.  I can now see fairly far into the shoe, and it looks to be glued with something vaguely resembling rubber cement; in any case, it\\'s certainly not strong enough.  Most quality shoes will stitch the sole to the shoe, but these ones do not.  I wouldn\\'t buy another Merrell shoe unless I could see the stitching in the picture at this point.  It\\'s very disappointing, as I was really getting into the feel of this shoe... I may even try to glue them myself, but frankly, one should never have to worry about such things a month after getting a pair of shoes.  If I were shopping for them myself, I\\'d keep looking.',\n",

If you plan to use this shoe in a professional environment, I would recommend the Midnight Leather model over the others.This shoe, with its unassuming appearance, performs well in so many situations.  It is durable so it functions beautifully as an everyday walking shoe.  It slips on easily and is very comfortable, so it can replace your household loafers.  It looks reasonably professional and has a conservative design, so it can be worn into a semi-formal (tie and slacks) work environment.I have owned 2 sets of these shoes, and each lasted through 3 years of extremely heavy use (daily walking on a college campus and through hospitals in medical school and residency).  I think 3 years is an excellent lifespan for a shoe which has taken that much abuse.  You may find something more durable, but it will not be as comfortable as these are.One shoe failed where the little toe bumper at the front meets the leather.  The other just had an elastic band which lost its recoil.  I am currently on my third pair.',\n",

They are comfortable, and also durable enough to go outside.  I particularly like this model as it has a leather inner lining.  Other models have a cloth lining that wears out quickly.',\n",

In my normal size, 11 EE, these just wouldn't work. The wide ... wasn't. Felt like my feet were in a vise. And the length, well, you'd probably want to go up a half-size just for length. So I did. I also went to a 4E extra wide.Gun boats. in a 11 4E the length was .. nearly okay. Still a bit short (honestly didn't seem any longer than the 11). The width was fine ... in the middle of the shoe. But somewhere along the line they brought in the toe-box, so in the 11 the toes were now crammed in.So I ended up paying return shipping twice, and no shoes. Very disappointing experience, and I won't likely give Merrell another chance.The shoes DID look nice, though. Pity.\",\n",

If I hadn't said anthing, I don't think anyone would have noticed.  Gotta have the light on when I put them on only for that reason.

On the downside though they are black seude shoes.  I must not have looked closely enough because I thought they were just black leather.  I suppose I just don't see myself as the type of guy that wears seude shoes.  I power through it though because these things are so comfortable.  They'll work great for casual wear in the winter/fall, but come summer spring I don't see myself sporting these shoes with shorts.

Skechers has a great selection of slip ons like this (I'm too lazy to worry about laces), but none of them felt that good, or looked right. Then I found these and said, yeah, that's it.

NEVER buy the Columbia knock offs as they only caused foot/knee issues for me and the sizes were off.  The Merrells are amazing!  The size is almost perfect, provides great support, durable, pretty water proof, and look great.  Wearing them every day in NYC year round, the traction will wear out in about 6-7 months.  When the traction wears out, they can become VERY slippery on wet surfaces so just be aware.  I still use my worn out ones for general around the house work or in the garden stuff, but just be careful on rainy/snow days if they are aging a bit.',\n",

Even then I kept them for work shoes since they were still functional but looked really beat up.  I'm still wearing my second pair but don't wear them very often once the snow hits.  This pair is on around year 3 also and the soles are completely flat in some spots now.  The elastic is stretched permanently and the adhesive is coming undone around the toes.  Some of the rubber is starting to deteriorate along the sides but he leather has no holes or tears. The built in plastic support around the ankle area has cracked on both shoes.  Nevertheless, they are still functional and extremely comfortable.  They keep my feet warm enough in the winter for casual wear but I would not dare use them for winter hiking or other winter sports for fear of frostbite.  Their dry traction seems to be pretty good and wet traction is decent.  Overall, these are a very good shoe.  My measured shoe size is between 9.5 and 10 (closer to 10) but this shoe in 9.5 fits perfect. If I had to approximate my exact size I'd be probably a 9.9.\",\n",

(Merrell makes endless variations of this shoe, and they are all pretty much the same, as far as I know.) Anyhow, I like them a lot - although the arch support could be better. I've worn mine at least 100 times, almost entirely indoors, and they are holding up well; they will probably last another 100 wearings! My wife thinks they are a bit dorky looking, but for a casual shoe they are dressier than sneakers or running shoes and they slip on and off easily.

My pair of Jungle moc feels like an extra wide, though the interior tag doesn\\'t say so. Once you\\'re actually IN the outhouse, the wideness comes in handy. However, the thing about outhouses is that they are set off from the house a ways, and there\\'s significant traffic from the porch steps to the outhouse door. The grass gets tramped down and dies, and when it rains the worn dirt track becomes muddy. So ON THE WAY there, you have to be careful not to lose a shoe. I\\'ll spare everyone a video review.

I cream my jeans when I see a product DESIGNED WELL. The Madza Miata (series N/A, N/B and N/C) is perfection as a SOTA roadster. The same with the IPOD, the IPHONE, the SUUNTO Vector ABC wrist computer and the Merrell Jungle Moc.Lets examine the shoe CLOSELY.  It resembles a HUSH PUPPY (remember those?) but what they did to it is beyond that technology. Hush Puppies were a yuppie office shoe---something you hid in your office and slipped on when no one noticed.  Now Compair the Hush Puppy to the Jungle Moc. Instead of a thin, rubbery soul and a 1\" heal, Merrell used an integrated, one piece sole which extends almost half way up the sides. Why do that? If you accidently step in 2\" of water, only your toes will get damp. Better yet, if you are climbing rocks and your foot slips, you got a 2\" safety core guarding your instep.  Now look inside. You have a wrapped liner with removable pad [FYI, I swear to God, I don\\'t work for Merrell---I am a epicure of great industrial design!!!]-that is why the shoe feels great straight out of the box and why Hush Puppies didn\\'t (spungie feel, loose fit). Slipping a Merrells over your feet feels like your feet are having sex---you have this \\'enveloping\\' sensation of foot and snug (but not tight) shoe. I brought two of them with me and sold them, unopened, for $200.00. DAMN!!!That said, there are negatives with Merrells. Don\\'t even think of wearing them without waterproofing them---they spot real easy. Second, you want to throughly examine the shoe before you buy them. They are made in China and a.) Sometimes they have too much/too little glue on them or b.) the leathers don\\'t match or c.) they were cut/blemished during shipping. TRY BEFORE YOU BUY!!! Also, sometimes the sizes are off. I am usually an 11 in everything else but in the MERRELLS, I have to buy 11.5\\'s. Finally, the Merrells are impossible to acquire---Nordstrom rarely has any and its the same with REI. REI said Merrells is thinking of discontinuing them and my jaw dropped. I only wear Merrells Jungle Mocs. PERIOD!!!  I will buy twenty pair if that happens. I mean I don\\'t wear sneakers, I wear Merrells!!! Sand, rock, wet decks/pavement, grass, dirt, board rooms---it\\'s your last shoe because it is the only shoe you need. FYI, every woman I go out with comments I look like I\\'m going on safari Kanga Hat, REI shirt, Kenya Convertable Cargos (the ones the legs zipper off) and my Merrells. Forget yer gym cloths? Unzip yer pants, slip yer Merrells back on and you good to go!!!PS: I\\'m desperate to replace my three RATTY Merrells Jungle Mocs. Today, 13DEC2011, I Went to Nordstroms, Sacramento: No Gots 3 weeks mail order?!!! From a Brick & Mortar?!!! Full Retail and tax?!! As If!!! REI: Pay for them now (Full retail and tax) and we will ship them in 5-12 days? ME WANTUM SHOES NOW!!!  What part of \\'Engish\\' you NO Understand?!! Went to THE WALKING STORE:  Merrells pulled their shoes from us...We do have some funky looking lace-ups, Mister!!! Went to Big 5 and tried on their $19.95 Jungle Moc knock-off from China. All I can say is now  I know how we located Osama Bin Ladin---we forced every detainee in GITMO to put them on and march around the base.  I was in PAIN after my sixth step, they were so badly made!!!Sacramento has NO MERRELLS Shoes!!!  I\\'m tempted to buy 20 (size 11.5, naturally) and put them in the back of my little red wagon and halk them downtown. My sign will read \\'SHOE SEX FOR YOUR FEET. Your ten little Piddies will kiss your feet in praise) NO MERRELL JUNGLE MOCS in SACRAMENTO!! No MERRELLs in Sacramento---Whaaaaaa!!!!',\n",

              "  'reviewText': 'If you are looking for a supportive, comfortable slip-on for work or for casual wear, you may want to consider \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" slip-ons.  These shoes are not light in weight; the pair (size 10 1/2D) weighs approximately 1 lb. 12 5/8 oz.  The suede is a good quality and finish on these slip-ons is clean and well done.  Interior seams are clean and the lining is soft and cushioned.  The soles are rubber and, if wearing these on wet surfaces, help prevent slipping.Because \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" are not flexible but are somewhat wide, you may find it necessary to order a smaller size than you normally wear.  My spouse wears an 11 D in Brooks running shoes and an 11D in most conventional shoes.  The \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" slip-ons that fit comfortably and did not gap or slide were a size 10 1/2D.  From the middle of the front to the center of the heel, the interior measurement on a 10 1/2D is approximately 11 \".  At the ball of the foot, the interior width is approximately 3 \"; at the heel, approximately the interior width is approximately 2\".Individuals having more sensitive feet may find the point at which the sole joins to the shoe, near the ball of the foot, somewhat irritating.  It was for this reason that my spouse purchased \"Skechers GoWalk2\" shoes and returned the \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" slip-ons.  Overall had his right foot not been so sensitive, he would have kept them as he did like these shoes.',\n",

I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of official feet problems but I know certain shoes hurt my feet badly and make my back ache.  Mostly cheap shoes like slip on vans and canvas shoes do not agree with me.  I had a pair of New Balance shoes that I have worn for the last 2 years because of how comfy they were.  But after wearing a pair of shoes everyday for 2 years, they were going south pretty quick.  The back area was completely void of any material so the plastic part that holds up the back of the shoe was exposed and tearing holes in my socks.  They also started to get this odd smell, kind of a sweet deathly smell that would be best described as a dead foot wrapped in bacon and covered with leather then left to bake in the sun.  I digress......so I ordered these shoes.  I eagerly awaited their delivery.  Once they got to my doorstep, I rushed in to tear open the package and try them (kicking off my NB shoes in the process, I think one stuck to the wall).  I was ready for the angels to weep and the birds to sing sweet melodies as I tried on the shoes.  I was ready for my feet pain to instantly disappear and my back to feel like I had just gone back in time 20 years when my back was great and strong like an ox.  I was ready to start dancing like Fred Astaire and for my tooth decay and gingivitis to be gone and be blessed with the sweetest smelling breath ever. I got both my feet in them and stood up.  They felt ok.\",\n",

There is a hard plastic piece behind the fabric that digs into your heel as you walk once the fabric is gone. I called Merrell about it and they said if I was kicking the shoes off with my other foot, it can cause the fabric to wear out on the inside of the heel. Well, this is one of the things I love about this shoe is the ease of putting them on and off without bending over. I don't know anyone that would not kick them off with the other foot. Sounds like a pre-rehearst excuse to me. I hate to throw away an otherwise good pair of shoes because of this issue but can't wear them as they hurt my heal.  I asked how else I would take them off and would they stand behind it if I took them off the way she suggested. She never gave me a clear explanation of how they should be taken off and dodged the question on whether they would stand behind it if I did it the way she suggested. Also said the material will deteriorate on its own if they are not worn and just left in a closet. Pretty lame. Not sure I would buy them again. Hope Merrell listens and fixes this problem to an otherwise great shoe.\",\n",

Young, athletic, sexy guys like them too (no offense dear diabetics and cripples--I aspire to be one of you someday).I *hate* tying my shoes. It\\'s such a waste of time. I treat all of my sneakers as slip-ons and I crush the heel within days. I go through shoes like there\\'s no tomorrow. I\\'ve had fitting problems before, so I was a bit skeptical of these at first, and I bought my first pair a half size too small (lamentably, I bought them in Hong Kong, so they were a tad difficult to return) to ensure a tight fit. That was completely unnecessary. After purchasing the correct size, I discovered that these things are amazingly well-designed. They magically hug your feet in the most comfortable manner--no slipping or sliding about. Oh, and they can be worn with EVERYTHING. Of course, I\\'m a guy...so everything can be worn with anything. But really, these shoes are beautiful.Two days ago, I discovered something completely unexpected (I didn\\'t read the shoe literature...maybe it\\'s expected): They\\'re surprisingly water-resistant. It was pouring here in California (East Coast translation: \"It was a tad humid\") and I stepped in a huge puddle while wearing my Gunsmoke Jungle Mocs. I flinched and waited for the gangrene to set in. Fourteen blocks and six puddles later, my feet were still dry. And did I mention I\\'ve been wearing this pair of shoes for over 9 months now?After finishing this review, I am going to go buy three more pairs of Merrell Jungle Moc shoes (gunsmoke, of course).

They have great traction on wet surfaces and are easy to clean with a stiff brush.  I wouldn't recommend buying them from Orvis.  My first order arrived with the wrong size.  Amazon was great and paid for the return and sent the replacement out again from Orvis, one day shipping.  Orvis shipped the wrong size again. I called Amazon and got the same great customer service for which they are noted.  Thankfully, this time the shoes arrived with the correct size although the box was crushed, but the shoes were not damaged.  In fairness to Orvis, by having three different sizes on the box - UK, USA, and Euro, I can understand how a warehouse employee could make a mistake, however their management could have become active in seeing that the first replacement order went out correctly.\",\n",

I always enjoy a good-fitting shoe, and was psyched when I discovered these Merells which were touted as ultra-comfortable. I was hoping that these could be a cheap alternative to my cole-haan slip-ons that I love, but find expensive.Here's my brief take on them:PROSFit- these surprisingly fit me in two sizes - 8 and 8.5!! For someone who is a bit particular with getting a good fit, this was quite a pleasant surprise.Ultra-Lightweight- what more can I say? They don't weigh a lot.CONSSupport- While they had a snug fit, I didn't feel they gave great overall support. I'm not sure why, but it may have been a combination of the lightweight sole not offering enough absorption and the sock-like side not offering enough reinforcement.Material. Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the sole nor with the suede. To be fair, I am not a great fan of suede anyway, so that may just be a personal bias. I got the impression that Merrell earned their reputation as a supreme-comfort brand, but kind of sol out somewehere along the way...You may like them, but ultimately I ended up returning all three sizes.\",\n",

This is due to the thinner lining in the shoe.  I'd think about getting one size smaller next time.  The lining of the shoe is also very smooth, so If the insole hasn't settled in, it will squeak like crazy due to the rubber material of the insole rubbing against the smooth lining.  My right shoe had this problem.  I had to add some felt tape to the underside of the insole to stop the squeaking.  Other than that , I'm very pleased with these shoes. They are very comfortable and well made, with the exception of the annoying squeaking issue.  Merrill makes a great pair of shoes!!\",\n",

I was looking for a good all around casual shoe that might last a while, these seemed to fit that bill.The design is pretty simple and practical.  The slip on design works well with a finger loop and an elastic wedge; The dual density sole is relatively light; and the tread pattern is reasonable for relatively rugged outdoor use, but not so thick or knobby so as to be cumbersome.  I'm used to running shoes which are usually excellent in the support department.  So, I can confidently attest to the support of these shoes; they are pretty comfortable to stand in.  Also worth noting is that they are not at all expensive for the type of shoe and materials used.Sizing these shoes can be a little tricky.  Because these shoes slip on, they need to be sized correctly or they will slip off easily, but because they are leather, there is very little give to accommodate a tight fit.  The shoes are secure on my feet when sized correctly, but it will likely depend highly on the shape of your feet.  To make matters worse, the sizing on these shoes seems to be a little funky.  I normally wear size 10. An ideal fit for these shoes on me is 8.5.  It took me 4 guesses to get the right size.  The moral of this story is to try on the size you are ordering at a department store first.I would recommend these shoes highly.  My advice is to try these on in a department store first, or at the very least choose a seller that offers free returns (be sure to check!).  Then, if you feel like saving maybe $10 you can buy them online.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"Update after 3 months of moderate to heavy use (1-2 hours per day on average):The upper has begun separating from the rubber at the toe of the shoe, allowing water to easily get in. It has become so bad that water wets my socks from a walk through a field with morning dew. When I received these, I noticed that there was only a small amount of glue that appeared to hold the rubber outsole to the upper at the toes and it looked pretty precarious. But, I figured that these were Merrell's and they would hold up. I expect more from Merrell and I expect more from an $80 shoe. They are still comfortable, but I am now pretty much restricted to using them indoors only. Based on the other reviews being overwhelmingly positive, I think this defect may be limited to the camo version.Otherwise, this is a nice shoe:Unlike neoprene versions (e.g., Bogs), these slippers are extremely breathable. They keep your feet comfortably warm in the cold (even in single digits), but they don't sweat. To me, there is no worse feeling than your feet shedding sweat nonstop because they can't breathe in your shoes. I will gladly trade the lack of complete waterproof-ness for breatheability. This breatheability also means that these are fine to wear in the summer, whereas those made from neoprene will be unbearably hot.These come in half-sizes. Many similar outdoor slippers do not, which can be a big deal if you wear a half-size. I am an 11.5, not a 12. I walk out of 12s and 11s scrunch my toes. Merrell is smart enough to realize that skipping out on half-sizes will make many people unable to wear these.These slippers are extremely comfortable and easy to slip in and out of. You can feel the cushioning as you walk -- it is firm, but cushioned -- exactly what I want in an outdoor slipper. They provide great traction and grip on all outdoor surfaces, including snow- and ice-covered surfaces.\",\n",

Even more of a surprise was the fitting. The length of the shoe is pretty accurate, but the fitting around the ankle is much too loose in my opinion. These seemed to be designed for wider feet and maybe I have slim feet/ankles, but I have a feeling this might be an issue for some. Yes, the shoe is easy to slip in and out of, which is kinda the intent  with this style, but I feel like I can almost slip out of them while I am walking normally.Comfort wise...very good, feel like I am walking on small boots and and can walk all day in these, no sole fatigue...these are good if you are standing up a lot or walking around all day...and these are convenient to slip in and out very easily without having to bend down and use your hands at all. Only thing I nit pick here is that with these soles, they make a lot of noise, almost clomping around in like boots, cant be stealthy in these. Maybe this might change in time, but for now, everyone is my building can here my footsteps as I approach.Overall, not too bad, pretty decent comfort, very comfortable casual shoe and can pass off as a boot type comfort...I would advise not getting the leather version though if you wanna look a bit more upscale, as this leather is not cut out for that. I would rate higher if this shoe was in the $70-80 range.Overall, I',\n",

I saw numerous others with the same complaint.  Merrell customer service said to put talcum powder between the insole and the sole.  That stopped the squeaking, but I found that I had to powder these shoes almost every time I wore them.  I don't think that is reasonable.  I waited a year and sent an email to Merrell to ask if they solved the problem.  The response was along the lines that they occasionally have quality issues but they would resolve them.  So I tried again.  Same problem, same proposed solution.  I returned the shoes this time.It is a shame that they have made some change to the design of these to cause them to squeak and apparently don't intend to fix it.

I decided to try Men's Merrell Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown and was very satisfied with every thing but the color. The Merrell Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown is not mahogany at all, not even close but rather a tan looking color. Beware that the Mahogany Brown as shown in the picture is not the correct color. It is a very light brown or tan colored shoe. I almost sent them back but the return time frame closed on me. If you like a lighter colored shoe this is a great and comfortable shoe. I do like the new sole on this shoe. It has a better grip support sole that the older Merrells. It is made of all smooth leather and not suede like most other Merrells.\",\n",

The Jungle Moc does not begin to compare to the Winter Moc.  These run small and they squeak.  I believe the squeaking comes from heel slip and the fact that the interior wall of the shoe is finished smooth leather as apposed to most shoes where the inside is the rough (felt) side of the leather.  I wore these to a family outing and by the end of the day my feet were sore and I hadn't done much walking.  I'm very disappointed and would not recommend these shoes to my worst enemy.\",\n",

I shopped around, read reviews, asked questions and tried several different brands.  I got my Merrells and from the moment I put them on I could tell that these were good shoes.  Good arch support and they cradle my heels so my foot doesn't slip around.  They are snug, but not too tight around all sides with a comfortable toe box.  I ordered 11's and sizing is accurate as I wear between a 10 1/2 and 11 and these aren't too tight or too loose.  I will definitely be ordering another pair in another week or so.\",\n",

Finding shoes I can wear all day at work in business casual dress without painful suffering has been a constant challenge.  Sketchers have been my go-to shoe for years.  They are a little uncomfortable in the beginning, but become acceptably pain free after breaking in and stretching over a couple of months.My wife swears by her Merrells and has told me over and over to try them.  When my last pair of Sketchers needed replacing, I went looking for Merrells.  I went to a Merrell store, told my story, and the shoe expert pointed me to the Jungle Moc in regular width.  The first pair I tried on had a pressure point in the arch, but the second pair fit perfectly.  They felt even better than my broken in, well worn Sketchers!  No break in period was required at all!  Absolutely no pain, ever!Now, here's the true test for me.  My feet swell and become extremely uncomfortable whenever I fly anywhere.  I typically fly wearing Birkenstocks just to avoid the foot pain once my feet swell.  Recently though we were flying to a location that had snow so the Birks weren't an option.  I wore the Merrell Mocs.  My feet never crossed my mind on the entire flight!I am now a Merrell customer for life.  Merrell, don't change a thing!\",\n",

Adding to my disappointment is the fact that the shoes squeak when I walk.  The product itself seems to be well made...and if properly sized I think the squeak would go away.  In any event...I have a pair of shoes in my closet that I probably won't wear again until next winter (with heavy socks).  Again...order small.  If they don't fit...exchange them.  Had I done either of these things I'm sure it would be a 4 star purchase.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"Merrell has been my go-to shoe company for many years and I've always been pleased with their products. That said, this particular shoe is terrible. There's absolutely no padding or arch support in the shoe at all. That makes them feel sloppy and poorly fitting while walking. I'd still give them 2 or 3 stars based on appearance and finish, but the real deal killer is the soles. They've been cheapened terribly and actually wheeze while being walked in, and not quietly either. It's just a rough guess, but the noise coming from both of these shoes could probably be heard in another room through a closed door. The noise is absolutely unacceptable and after trying to live with the shoes for a few days I threw them back in the box and intend to give them to charity. I wore them enough to feel badly about returning them, so giving them away is easier on my conscience. Bottom line, they look great, but aren't worth buying at any price, let alone nearly $100. Try the other shoes in Merrell's line, most of those still seem to be made with some integrity. But if the problem of poor quality control with the soles starts to invade Merrell's other products, I'll be an ex-customer.\",\n",

If you've had problems with other manufacturers having been too small, or too large forget it. Merrell got it right. I wear these everyday everywhere, from the backwoods of Tennessee for morning, or evening dog walks around the lake on rugged trails, to grocery shopping in town, and sometimes church on Sunday. I suggested my wife try them as she frequently experienced foot pain without her RX inserts, and she now loves, and swears by them also. They are absolutely good to go for a full year of constant wear, and then retire them as your everyday house slippers, when you order thier Merrell replacements. Tried brand X, but there is no real substitute apples for apples, in regard to comfort or longeveity :o)\",\n",

The uppers are tight enough that they don't slide around too much. They seem to really match the shape of my feet so there are no tight spots. No squeaks. They hold up really well over time (I'll buy a new pair every 2-3 years).Over the years I've tried a few copy cats. I don't know what kind of mojo Merrell has, but they have it. None of the copy cats work at all: they slide around too much on my feet, or rub when I walk, or squeak.These mocs seem to be just right. Some of the other leather Merrell mocs now have a squeak to them (not sure what's changed or if I have a bad pair). I've had 3-4 pairs of these suede mocs over the years. They're always good.\",\n",

They are not the best for activity such as running or power walking or any type of sport, but for just casual walks and around the house, they are very comfortable.  They are also very convenient to slip on and off - especially if you're visiting places that require the removal of shoes.  I just use the toes of my other foot to press on the heel and they slip right off - no need to even bend over.  And putting feet inside to slip them on is just as easy.The shoes run large.  I usually wear an 8 1/2.  My Nike shoes I get a half size larger - 9s.  The Merrell shoes I get a half size smaller - 8s.  These shoes are not comfortable if they're tight and they're not comfortable if they are loose.  So, the trick is to find the exact correct size.  That is not easy.  Through trial and error, my first pair of Merrells ended up being an 8 2E pair.  They fit just ever so slightly loose, but were okay.  When they got a little worn, I ordered another exact pair - 8 2E, but for some strange reason, these were looser than the previous pair - even though the sizing was exactly the same.  I purchased some shoe liners to try to make them tighter but it hasn't worked very well. I can still wear them, but my left shoe slips up and down my heel when I walk which is a annoying, so I prefer to wear my old ones whenever possible.Other than the sizing and uniformity issues, I really like these shoes.\",\n",

I have a wide foot and most shoes constrain my feet so much that they hurt. These shoes fit much better due to the elastic band on either side of the tongue (that's the little black strips you see on the top). My feet used to hurt at the end of the day, even when I wore brands known for comfort, but with the Merrell's they don't hurt at all. I wear these shoes with casual clothes at work and on the weekend. I can kick the soccer ball and run around playing football with my kids in these shoes (which I share only to illustrate that they stay on well even though they're slip-on-shoes). The shoes are also super-lightweight. I tend to keep them on even when I'm walking around the neighborhood.I wear a pair of these shoes every day (and have for the past 4-5 years), so I can tell you that they tend to last about two years (of everyday wear) before they start to reach retirement age. On my shoes, the outer layer of the sole (the black part) wears through in two years around the heal. Also, the sole at the toe starts to come loose after about two years. Keep in mind that I'm talking about two years of constant wear plus I tend to be pretty hard on shoes. The area wear you insert your foot doesn't seem to wear or tear at all, even though you slip them on and off all the time. You don't have to use your hands to slip these shoes on and off, which I also like. I find myself slipping them off under my desk and in meetings a lot.These shoes aren't quite dressy enough for wearing with dress pants, but they're fine for kakis or jeans. I find they're the perfect shoe for traveling as they can be super casual or business casual, and they're easy for going through airport security. I will wear these shoes until they stop making them because they're one of my favorite products ever made.\",\n",

So now I have to wonder if they just dont put the W on the inside tag, or if they shipped the wrong product.I tried them on and WAY TOO TIGHT! Obviously these are not a proper wide size so now I have to wonder if all Merrells are a snug fit and Wide really just means Normal, or if I got the wrong product. Since no store anywhere in 50 miles of me keeps the wide sizes in stock, I will never know.They look nice and seem like they'd be comfortable if they are the right size, and I think they provide good traction on slick surfaces, but since I am returning them I didnt feel like making a trip around the block. Shame, because I think these are exactly what I need for walking around this winter.Be aware if you have wide feet you probably will not be able to find comfortable Jungle Moc's.\",\n",

I got used to it within my first few times wearing them, though. Now, when I put them on, which is super easy to do, I am happy because they feel so good. I expect they will last a while because of their tread. I have some Merrell hiking boots too, and those have held up well. Also, I have gotten these Jungle Mocs pretty wet from all the snow, but it doesn't seem to affect them.The design of the shoe almost looks slipper-like, what with having no strings, so I admit they sometimes look silly to me. I got them in black, but maybe the darker brown or white may appear more normal. I'm no fashion expect so I don't really know, but that also means I don't really care. I walk around campus a lot so these are wonderful for me. If you care a lot about fashion then take their appearance into consideration, of course.Overall they rock.

The upper is advertised as  to be made of leather, but feels like low quality hard, plastic with fuzz on it to make it look like suede. The sole is also made of some kind of hard plastic. The sole is so narrow that shoe gives no lateral support at all, it feels like walking with roller-blades. The quality is just not there and they charge outrageous price for it. I had Rockport shoes, same size, same style from Costco for about half the price of these &#34;shoes&#34;, and they are great.These shoes are almost new, Amazon will not take it back, so they are going straight to the trash. Do not believe the good reviews like I did.',\n",

This is my second pair of Merrell shoes; the other pair are the Olmec slip-ons and are at least as good. Both pairs were an exact fit in my usual 11.5 size. From my two purchases the shoes fit and feel great as soon as I put them on. There is no break-in period for me and the comfort is better than any other dress/casual shoes I own. I have owned lots of GBX and Doc Marten's and have ventured into Rockports and several other brands of dress shoe, but not a single pair hold a candle to these Merrell's. I am a diabetic and am very picky about shoes and socks and if these were twenty five a pair instead of ninety plus I would already be trying out several more styles. I intend to purchase more anyway, but only as the budget (and my wife) will allow. You get what you pay for and these are worth the money. As an aside, one guy's review mentioned that there are two &#34;flavors&#34; of these, the crisscross patterned soles or the oval knobs sole and to avoid the crisscross pattern.

A pair of these Jungle Mocs lasts me about 6 to 8 months of occasional wear--they are the shoes that I keep by the door to slip on when I leave the house as I don't wear outdoor shoes in the house.  I have had a couple of pairs that were replaced by the shoe store (which is over 30 miles away) because the sole separated after a month of wear, while other pairs have held up okay until the soles were worn enough to make it obvious that they should be replaced. Every pair that I have had has worn through at the back where my heel rubs on the inside of the shoe, sometimes wearing until the plastic inside of the shoe is cutting into my foot.  I will probably keep buying these shoes because no one else makes anything any better, not because they are really a great shoe.  I wish that a quality company like Keene made a wide shoe so I could give them at try.\",\n",

Now, they have expanded their line of shoes to the more traditonal,  as well as expanding the variations on the Moc.First of all, these are very comfortable and supportive. You can wear them all day, just like the Mocs, though they are a bit more traditional/conservative style wise.If you are looking for stylish streamlined fashion statments, these are not for you. However, if comfort and support are your prime concerns, then these are for you. They have a  squared off look to them rather than the ovoid shape of the Mocs. This along with a more tradional sole, give the shoe the appearance of being a run of the mill shoe, perfect for work with a suit or more casual attire. But Merrel has designed the comfort of the Moc into these, and these require no break in or compromise to instant comfort.I do recommend them.',\n",

I saw these, and I figured I could return them if they didn\\'t fit, but fit they did, and they are truly as comfortable as slippers. My first pair - I now have three - became my driving-digging in the garden-walking pair, and though they look \"used,\" they are still holding up and are still comfortable.Merrel\\'s actually come in a \"medium\" width instead of a standard EEE, and that\\'s great. They hold and cushion your foot, and there are no seams inside the toe to cause running and blisters. The sole is like a cushion, but has tread that holds up. They do not deteriorate as my ECCOs did.I can\\'t think of a single \"con,\" and would recommend these highly even if you want to use them with a tux.

I'm pretty rough on my shoes, and with no care (I'm lazy), they still look great. I like the way they look.

They do have a larger, boxier toe that does make them more of a casual look than something you would wear to dress up in.  I\\'m mostly wearing them in a business casual work environment with some weekend duty.  The leather has a pebbly grain to it that looks good when they start to break in.  I have the \"redwood\" model.A lot of reviews comment on the style, but I find very few mention the sizing for some reason.  Since it\\'s easy enough to tell if you like them or not, I\\'ll discuss the fit.  Normally, I wear a 13 in athletic shoes (Nike, Brooks) and a 12 in a boot or dress shoe.  I ordered these in the size 12 and found them to be a little larger than my usual 12 fit. After breaking in over the weekend with a lot of walking, it seemed like they loosened up a bit and are now about a 1/2 size too large.  I wear super-thick Thorlo socks with them, so it might be a full size with \"regular\" socks.  Arch support isn\\'t as much as I would like, either.  But arch support and fit can be addressed with an insert.If I buy these again, I\\'ll get them a half-size smaller.',\n",

              "\"I just received these yesterday so I can't comment on the durability or function yet.  Don't know how they are going to feel after 5 miles on the trail or how they hold up crossing a stream.  However, they are very comfortable...so far so good.I bought these reluctantly.  I own a pair of Merrell Moab that I wear for almost everything.  They fit like a dream and wear like a sneaker.  But recently on long hikes I've had ankle pain because of an old football injury, and I decided I needed more ankle support.  That's what lead me to the Sawtooths.  Somehow Merrell figured out how to make a very big, clunky looking boot actually lightweight.  I think these are even lighter than my Moab's and they're much more waterproof.A note on the size...my feet are 11.5, but on my 2 other Merrell's I got a 12 because they run small.  The Sawtooth was not available in 12 so I got 11.5...fearing they would be too small.  These fit to size.  They are very comfortable, even with thicker socks.Finally, I rubbed some mink oil into the leather to condition and water proof.  It made them a shade darker but I think I actually prefer the new color.I might update this review after I've had a chance to really break them in and test them out...but early indications are very good.\""

              "\"I just received these yesterday so I can't comment on the durability or function yet.  Don't know how they are going to feel after 5 miles on the trail or how they hold up crossing a stream.  However, they are very comfortable...so far so good.I bought these reluctantly.  I own a pair of Merrell Moab that I wear for almost everything.  They fit like a dream and wear like a sneaker.  But recently on long hikes I've had ankle pain because of an old football injury, and I decided I needed more ankle support.  That's what lead me to the Sawtooths.  Somehow Merrell figured out how to make a very big, clunky looking boot actually lightweight.  I think these are even lighter than my Moab's and they're much more waterproof.A note on the size...my feet are 11.5, but on my 2 other Merrell's I got a 12 because they run small.  The Sawtooth was not available in 12 so I got 11.5...fearing they would be too small.  These fit to size.  They are very comfortable, even with thicker socks.Finally, I rubbed some mink oil into the leather to condition and water proof.  It made them a shade darker but I think I actually prefer the new color.I might update this review after I've had a chance to really break them in and test them out...but early indications are very good.\""

They fit was great, the arch was comfortable and my feet did not hurt at the end of a long day of walking; they worked well in mud and grit,  and they were very water resistent. However, these mocs are DANGEROUS on wet, smooth rock/tile/cobble surfaces. They have no traction on such surfaces. The treads are not deep, so wet grass or leaves stick on the soles and turn the mocs into ice skates on wet surfaces. A few other comments related this slipping problem but I'd passed them over. You must be very careful. Choose another shoe if you know you will be in an area with stone surface sidewalks or streets.Without doubt some ugly shoes: suede mocs that have grafted with a tentacled sea creature. They look bulky but are surprisingly light. They slip right on and suck your feet in. The insole is well padded- I have high arches and PF and  I find that in shoes with good arch height, the support is either too soft or too hard, if that makes any sense. The arches in these are prominent, yet a bit too hard; after a few hours of walking around I can tell I'll need to take a break. The heel is well supported. I'm a 7.5 and find that they fit well with some room to wiggle- wearing thicker socks will make them more snug. 7 would probably fit closer but allow for less winter sock width.  Constructed well, I expect that these should last several years as travel and weekend shoes.\"]\n"

As a surgical resident, I use Encore clogs on days that I am in the OR and have to stand for hours on end.

The open back of the clog allows much better air circulation and standing comfort than the Moc.  But the clog is slightly less natural to walk in and is harder to run in (for example, when you get called to a code) than the Moc.
